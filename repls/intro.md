# Introduction to Repls

Welcome to Replit, your integrated development environment which makes it simple for you to host and deploy in your preferred language, and easily share your work with the world. All from one platform. 

## Why Replit?

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. A REPL will take input (_read_), run those commands/code (_evaluate_), and _print_ out the results, all in a _loop_. This was initially the starting point of Replit; however, our repls have since exceeded that definition and are now capable of much more.

A repl is an interactive programming environment. You can create a workspace in any number of [languages](https://repl.it/languages). This workspace provides you with a container on a virtual machine where your code can run. In any given repl, there are two main parts – the editor and the console.

The editor uses [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the same technology that powers Visual Studio Code ([learn some tips and tricks](/repls/editor)). On mobile, the editor is [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/).

## Get Oriented

Start coding in your _main_ body section in the left-hand window; define variables and insert elements. 

The _console_, on the right, is where you will see your standard output and where you will be prompted to enter standard input. In most languages, the console doubles as an interactive prompt – you can evaluate snippets of code interactively, and in [some cases](/repls/files), you can interact with variables that have been defined in your main body of code.

To get up and running quickly, head to the [quick start guide](/repls/quick-start) or [tutorials page](https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/00-overview) to learn what you can do with repls.
